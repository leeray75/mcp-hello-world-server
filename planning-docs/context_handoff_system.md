# Multi-Task Context Handoff System for MCP Server Implementation

## Initial Planning Prompt (Before Task 1)

```
I'm implementing an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server in 4 separate Cline AI tasks to avoid context window issues. This is the planning phase.

Project Goal: Create a minimal MCP server with Docker support demonstrating Tools, Resources, and Prompts.

Requirements:
- Node.js 22+ with TypeScript
- @modelcontextprotocol/sdk ^1.17.4
- Docker support for production
- MCP Inspector integration for testing
- All 3 MCP capabilities: Tools, Resources, Prompts

Please confirm you understand the multi-task approach and that you'll create a context handoff document at the end of your task. The phases are:
- Task 1 (Phase 1): Project setup, dependencies, TypeScript config
- Task 2 (Phase 2): Core MCP server implementation  
- Task 3 (Phase 3): Docker configuration and scripts
- Task 4 (Phase 4): Documentation and final testing

Are you ready to proceed with this approach?
```

## Task 1 Prompt (Phase 1)

```
TASK 1: MCP Server Phase 1 - Project Setup & Configuration

This is Task 1 of 4 for implementing an MCP server with multi-task context handoff.

Please implement Phase 1 following this document exactly:
[PASTE PHASE 1 DOCUMENT HERE]

CRITICAL: At the end of this task, create a file called `TASK1_HANDOFF.md` that documents:
1. What was completed successfully
2. Current project state (files created, structure)
3. What the next task (Phase 2) needs to know
4. Any issues encountered and their solutions
5. Verification steps that prove Phase 1 is working

This handoff document is essential for Task 2 to understand the project state.
```

## Task 2 Prompt (Phase 2)

```
TASK 2: MCP Server Phase 2 - Core Server Implementation

This is Task 2 of 4 for implementing an MCP server. Task 1 (Phase 1) has been completed.

FIRST: Please read and understand the context from the previous task:
- Read `TASK1_HANDOFF.md` to understand what was completed
- Verify the project state matches what's documented

THEN: Implement Phase 2 following this document:
[PASTE PHASE 2 DOCUMENT HERE]

CRITICAL: At the end of this task, create `TASK2_HANDOFF.md` documenting:
1. What was implemented in Phase 2
2. Current project state including new files
3. Test results (MCP Inspector integration)
4. What Task 3 (Docker phase) needs to know
5. Any modifications made to existing files

Task 3 will need this context to implement Docker support.
```

## Task 3 Prompt (Phase 3)

```
TASK 3: MCP Server Phase 3 - Docker Configuration

This is Task 3 of 4 for implementing an MCP server. Tasks 1-2 have been completed.

FIRST: Please read the context from previous tasks:
- Read `TASK1_HANDOFF.md` for Phase 1 context
- Read `TASK2_HANDOFF.md` for Phase 2 context  
- Verify the working MCP server exists and functions

THEN: Implement Phase 3 following this document:
[PASTE PHASE 3 DOCUMENT HERE]

CRITICAL: At the end of this task, create `TASK3_HANDOFF.md` documenting:
1. Docker implementation completed
2. All scripts created and tested
3. Container build and run verification
4. What Task 4 (documentation phase) needs to know
5. Complete project structure and working features

Task 4 will use this to create final documentation.
```

## Task 4 Prompt (Phase 4)

```
TASK 4: MCP Server Phase 4 - Documentation & Final Testing

This is the FINAL task (4 of 4) for the MCP server implementation.

FIRST: Please read all context from previous tasks:
- Read `TASK1_HANDOFF.md` for Phase 1 setup
- Read `TASK2_HANDOFF.md` for core server implementation
- Read `TASK3_HANDOFF.md` for Docker configuration
- Understand the complete project state

THEN: Implement Phase 4 following this document:
[PASTE PHASE 4 DOCUMENT HERE]

FINAL: Create `PROJECT_COMPLETE.md` documenting:
1. Complete project summary
2. All features implemented and tested
3. Final project structure
4. Deployment instructions
5. Integration guide for Claude Desktop
6. Any known issues or future improvements

This completes the multi-task MCP server implementation!
```

## End-of-Task Prompts

### After Task 1:
```
Perfect! Phase 1 is complete. Please create the TASK1_HANDOFF.md file using the template I provided, filling in all the actual details of what was accomplished. This will be essential for Task 2 to understand the project state.

Once the handoff document is created, this task is complete and I'll start Task 2.
```

### After Task 2:
```
Excellent! Phase 2 is complete. Please create the TASK2_HANDOFF.md file documenting what was implemented and the current state of the working MCP server. Include the testing results from MCP Inspector.

This handoff document will allow Task 3 to implement Docker support with full context of the working server.
```

### After Task 3:
```
Great! Phase 3 is complete. Please create the TASK3_HANDOFF.md file documenting the Docker implementation and all the scripts that were created and tested.

This will provide Task 4 with everything needed to create comprehensive documentation and perform final testing.
```

### After Task 4:
```
Outstanding! The project is complete. Please create the final PROJECT_COMPLETE.md file that summarizes the entire implementation and provides deployment guidance.

This completes the multi-task MCP server implementation!
```

## Benefits of This Approach

✅ **Clean Context**: Each task starts fresh but with precise context  
✅ **Full Documentation**: Every step is documented for troubleshooting  
✅ **Verification Points**: Each task can verify previous work  
✅ **Error Recovery**: If a task fails, the handoff shows exactly what worked  
✅ **Knowledge Transfer**: Complete project understanding preserved  
✅ **Debugging Aid**: Clear trail of what was implemented when  

This system ensures seamless handoffs between tasks while maintaining full project continuity!
