# MCP Server Implementation - Complete Phase Guide

## Overview
This guide breaks down the MCP server implementation into 4 manageable phases to avoid context window issues with Cline AI.

## Phase Execution Strategy

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Configuration
**Focus**: Foundation, dependencies, TypeScript setup
**Time Estimate**: 10-15 minutes
**Files Created**: package.json, tsconfig.json, .gitignore
**Success Criteria**: Clean npm install, TypeScript configuration works

### Phase 2: Core MCP Server Implementation  
**Focus**: Main server code with all MCP capabilities
**Time Estimate**: 20-30 minutes  
**Files Created**: src/index.ts (complete server implementation)
**Success Criteria**: Server builds, MCP Inspector shows all features

### Phase 3: Docker Configuration & Scripts
**Focus**: Production deployment, Docker optimization
**Time Estimate**: 15-20 minutes
**Files Created**: Dockerfile, .dockerignore, 3 shell scripts
**Success Criteria**: Docker builds and runs successfully

### Phase 4: Documentation & Final Testing
**Focus**: Complete docs, testing, validation
**Time Estimate**: 15-20 minutes
**Files Created**: README.md, LICENSE, DEVELOPMENT.md, STATUS.md
**Success Criteria**: All documentation complete, full test suite passes

## How to Use with Cline AI

### Recommended Approach:

1. **Start with Phase 1**
   - Give Cline AI only the "Phase 1" document
   - Wait for complete implementation and testing
   - Verify success criteria are met

2. **Move to Phase 2**
   - Start new conversation with Cline AI (to reset context)
   - Provide "Phase 2" document
   - Reference that Phase 1 is already complete
   - Wait for implementation and testing

3. **Continue with Phase 3**
   - New conversation for Phase 3
   - Mention Phases 1-2 are complete
   - Focus only on Docker implementation

4. **Finish with Phase 4**
   - Final conversation for documentation
   - Reference all previous phases complete
   - Focus on docs and final validation

### Alternative Approach:
If you prefer to use single conversation:
- Implement phases sequentially
- Ask Cline to confirm completion before moving to next phase
- Take breaks between phases to let context reset naturally

## Context Window Benefits

**Why This Approach Works:**
- Each phase fits comfortably in Cline AI's context window
- Clear, focused objectives for each phase  
- Reduced risk of truncation or forgotten instructions
- Easier debugging if issues arise
- Natural stopping points for testing

**Phase Sizes:**
- Phase 1: ~1,500 tokens
- Phase 2: ~3,500 tokens  
- Phase 3: ~2,500 tokens
- Phase 4: ~3,000 tokens

Total: ~10,500 tokens across 4 phases vs ~8,000+ tokens in single phase

## Success Indicators

### Phase 1 Success:
```bash
npm install  # completes without errors
npx tsc --noEmit  # no TypeScript errors
```

### Phase 2 Success:
```bash
npm run build  # compiles successfully
npm run inspect  # MCP Inspector shows all capabilities
```

### Phase 3 Success:  
```bash
npm run docker:build  # image builds
npm run docker:run    # container starts
docker ps             # shows running container
```

### Phase 4 Success:
```bash
# All documentation files exist and are comprehensive
# Final test sequence passes completely
```

## Tips for Cline AI Implementation

1. **Be Specific**: Each phase has exact file contents and commands
2. **Test Incrementally**: Verify each step before proceeding
3. **Use Success Criteria**: Don't move forward until criteria are met
4. **Handle Errors**: Each phase includes troubleshooting guidance
5. **Take Breaks**: Let Cline complete each phase fully before continuing

## Troubleshooting by Phase

### Phase 1 Issues:
- Node.js version compatibility
- npm installation problems
- TypeScript configuration errors

### Phase 2 Issues:
- Import/export syntax for ES modules
- MCP SDK API usage
- TypeScript compilation errors

### Phase 3 Issues:  
- Docker installation/running
- Shell script permissions
- Container networking

### Phase 4 Issues:
- Documentation accuracy  
- Final integration testing
- Missing file permissions

## Final Result
After all 4 phases, you'll have:
- ✅ Complete MCP server with all capabilities
- ✅ Production-ready Docker deployment
- ✅ MCP Inspector integration for testing
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Ready for Claude Desktop integration
- ✅ Scalable architecture for future enhancements

This phased approach ensures Cline AI can implement everything correctly without running into context limitations or losing track of requirements.
